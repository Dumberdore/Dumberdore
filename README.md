## _Hey  there!_  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prakashdumbre-toast/prakashdumbre-toast/main/wave.gif" width="30">  
 

I am Prakash, an **Engineering Manager** @[Wesco](https://wesco.com).

I enjoy programming in Go & Python! In previous jobs, I have worked with C/C++, Hack, and various scripting languages.

Before joining Wesco, I have been a Software Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Lecturer.
Alongside coding, I have been moonlighting as a Poker Player and an amateur photographer.

Cheers! üçª
