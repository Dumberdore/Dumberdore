👋  
_Hello_, I am Prakash Dumbre.

I am working @ _Toast_ as *DevOps Engineer*. My work mostly involves around IaaC.
Python has been my go-to programming language although I am learning Golang and loving it so far! In previous jobs, I have worked with C/C++, Hack, and various scripting languages.


Before joining Toast, I have been a Software Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Lecturer.
Besides coding, I have been moonlighting as a Poker Player. I am also decent table tennis player and an amateur photographer.

Reach out to me at pkya@outlook.in

Cheers! 🍻
